    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "1. **Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.**  \n",
    " E-mail spam detection.\n",
    "2. **What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**  \n",
    "  It’s easy to implement and scale with a dataset. \n",
    "3. **What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**   \n",
    "  Due to their simplicity, the model is often beaten by models properly trained and tuned (EliteDataScience, 2017). It also can’t learn interactions between features.(Chen, n.d.)\n",
    "4. **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**  \n",
    "   We predict two-categorical value (“<=50” or “>50”). Furthermore, most of predictors are independent. \n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "1. **Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.**  \n",
    "Face detection: SVMc classify parts of the image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face (Data Flair, 2017)\n",
    "2. **What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**  \n",
    "SVM's can model non-linear decision boundaries, and there are many kernels to choose from. They are also fairly robust against overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space(EliteDataScience, 2017).\n",
    "3. **What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**   \n",
    "SVM's are memory intensive, trickier to tune due to the importance of picking the right kernel, and don't scale well to larger datasets (EliteDataScience, 2017).\n",
    "4. **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**  \n",
    "The dataset is high-dimentional (103 features after one-hot encoding). It is reasonable to assume that the dataset has non-linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adaboost\n",
    "1. ** Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.**  \n",
    "Adaboost algorithm is used for object detection called Viola-Jones object Detection (Lowe, 2001).\n",
    "2. **What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**  \n",
    "Adaboost uses Decision Tree algorithm as a weak learner, which can handle both numerical and categorical data (Scikit learn, n.d.). In AdaBoost, the user only needs to choose which classifier to use and the number of boosting rounds although it shows a similar performance with more complex algorithm with more parameters and settings (GRT, 2016).\n",
    "3. **What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**  \n",
    "AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers (GRT, 2016).\n",
    "4. **What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**  \n",
    "   - The dataset contains both numerical and categorical data, which can be handled by this algorithm.\n",
    "   - It is reasonable to assume that the dataset has non-linear relationship. \n",
    "   - The algorithm quickly fit the dataset of 36177 observations.    \n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    "   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!"

    "I decided to use Adaboosting for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the model is trained?**\n",
    " \n",
    " Adaboosting is one of the ensemble techniques. We can set two parameters; ``base_estimator`` and ``n_estimators``. The first parameter is to set the algorithm of a weak learner. A weak learner is the simple model performing at least better than random guess, and combined to make a final prediction. The second parameter is to set how many weak learners we combine. \n",
    " By default, Adaboost in scikitlearn uses dicision tree as a weak learner. I think it is a good idea to use a decision tree as a weak learner for this dataset because the target value is the two categorical values (\"<=50k\" or \">50k\"). Decision tree is the algorithm to split a dataset iteratively into smaller subsets so that subsets contains the same class as much as possible. The final model takes the shape of tree with nodes and leafs. An user can set the depth of a tree (``max_depth`` parameter) and how many samples a leaf contains at minimum (``min_samples_leaf`` parameter). By default, adaboost uses one-level decision tree called decision stump.   \n",
    " \n",
    " Let's explain how adaboost works more in detail. Firstly, the algorithm evenly weighted data points and make a weak model. Secondly, it changes how it weights data points so that misclassified data points are weighted more. Thirdly, it makes a new model for the new weighted model. Because the data points previously misclassified are weighted more, the new model is likely to classify them correctly. In returns, the new model is less likely to misclassify the data previously misclassified. But, it's O.K because it finally combines all weak learners and takes only their strength. The algorithm repeats this process until the pre-set number of a weak learner, which user sets, is created or there is no further improvement can be made on the training dataset.  \n",
    " \n",
    "**How the model makes a prediction?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model stores a certain number of weak learners. For each input, weak learners respectively predict an output, which is either +1.0 or -1.0. Then, it calculates the weighted average from outputs of weak learners. The important thing is that it weighs weak learners so that it takes only their strength, in other words, the part a weak learner predict correctly. Finally, it decides the value of prediction by seeing the weighted average of weak learner's predictions. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
